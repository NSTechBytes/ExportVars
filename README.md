# ExportVars
ExportVars.dll is a Rainmeter plugin that allows you to copy variables from a source .ini file to a destination .ini file. The plugin will update the destination file by replacing existing variables with the values from the source file and adding new variables from the source file if they do not already exist in the destination file.
